I've been struggling a little lately with making coding fun and interesting and I thought doing a challenge could change that. Hopefully this will reinstore my passion for coding! :)

### Day 1:
This was a fun first challenge! I expected it to not be that complicated since it's day 1 and I was right, finding the solution for part 2 wasn't all that obvious to me but I made it work.

### Day 2:
Day 2 was slightly harder, the hardest part to me was to make my code readable, so I opted for tokenization as a way to make it a lot easier on me to go through the strings. Part 2 was very easy this time, there was barely any changes to be made to the functions I had already done, which can be seen in the comments of the code.
